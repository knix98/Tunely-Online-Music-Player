# Tunely-Online-Music-Player

URL -> (https://knix98.github.io/Tunely-Online-Music-Player/)

Only used HTML and CSS to build this project.

Made 2 webpages:
1. index.html
2. single playlist screen.html - this page can be accessed, if you click on one of the "Popular Artists" images.

Both the web pages are interactive and you can see various popups, animations, effects, etc. on clicking of the various clickable elements present on the pages.

Don't forget to see the custom bottom music player, which will be visible at the bottom of the screen if you click the play button which appears when you hover over any of the song images on the page.
